  * Beyond point-and-click
 
  * The goal of the Exploring series is to move students beyond the point-and-click, to understanding the why and how behind each skill. And because so much learning takes place outside of the classroom, this series provides learning tools that students can access anywhere, anytime. Students go to college now with a different set of skills than they did years ago. With this in mind, the Exploring series seeks to move students beyond the basics of the software at a faster pace, without sacrificing coverage of the fundamental skills that everyone needs to know.
